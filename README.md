# AQI-Prediction
•	Developed an Air Quality Index (AQI) predictor which which is used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecasted to become. Predicting AQI involves a combination of environmental monitoring, data collection, and mathematical modeling.
•	It was achieved by various machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests to capture non- linear patterns, Support Vector Machines (SVM) to find both linear and non-linear relationships, and Neural Networks to Capture complex patterns and dependencies.
